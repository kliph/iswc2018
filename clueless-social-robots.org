* Social robotics
* Human computer interactions and knowledge-based learning
* Ontology Bingo
- OWL
- Hypertext
- Ontology
* Robots
- Embodied in our world
- Physicality separates it from abstract decision algorithms
- Require integration of many systems
  - Challenging
* Robots require many teams
- Difficult to share knowledge
- Interactions are typical to software development
  - git push
  - git pull
* Cultural norms
- Growing up in Nigeria
- Moving back to Netherelands
- Social learning
- Cultural learning
* Human development
- Early face to face communication
- Social referencing
- Taking cues in an environment to determine appropriate behaviors
- Japanese Chimpanzee researcher thinks that active teaching, active learning, social referencing is critical for acculturation
* Daniel Dennet
- It's robots all the way down
- Motor proteins are nano robots
  - Don't know who you are or care
- Culture defines the "apps" that get installed in our human brains
  - Software derived from shared knowledge in the culture make consciousness
* Enculturation
- Being able to learn from others
- Efficient way to transfer knowledge
* Technology is clueless to our environment and social cues
* Technology should be able to learn from our social cues
* Artificial enculturation
* Detecting facial features
- Tracking
  - Arousal
  - Valence
* Analyzed speed dating
- Complex social behavior
- Predict whether there will be a match
- Twente University research group did this study
- Predictors of a match?
  - Body language
    - No
  - Distance
    - Close ("I can see you're an experience dater")
  - Orientation around a cocktail table
    - So: Personal space
    - "Use this knowledge wisely"
* Zoo animals check out robot
* Algorithm from goofy robot â†’ pedestrian detection algorithm in mercedes benz cars
* Don't name a robot after a family member
- Spencer the robot, not the partner, thinks about peopel as a group
- Took video data from Schiphol
- Robot plans navigation through groups of people
  - Takes into account how people relate to each other when navigating
- Dynamic pattern between people's movement
- Whether people's noses are pointing toward each other or in the same direction
* EU PF7 SQUIRREL project
- Robot that can clean up Lego
- Unethical
  - Children need to learn how to clean up
- Robot creates a game that helps children clean up
- Understand children's social dynamics
- 4 year project
* Facial expression robot
- Helps train children with autism to communicate through facial expressions
- http://de-enigma.eu
- Reduce anxiety to encourage learning
- Therapist using a robot as a mediator
* Telepresence robotics
- Can automatically position a telepresence platform based on the attention of the people in an environment
* How can a driverless car communicate with a pedestrian
- Regulations
  - Can't put an autonomous car on the road with nonstandard behaviors
  - Can't experiment easily
- Hidden driver of a normal car
- Fake autonomous car
* Record human wearing a VR headset in a moving car
- Gives a robot (ie. Machine Learning algorithm) good data on how a human would behave in a similar situation
* Questions
- For autistic children How different is a robot from an ipad?
  - There is a study
  - Children teach a robot / ipad
  - When it was a robot, the children spoke more and spoke more accurately
  - Maybe the physical presence encourages social behavior
- What about humans adapting to robots?
  - Hoping that robots will feel completely natural in a social situation
  - Robots' behavior will make sense to us
  - Novelty is a problem right now
  - Novelty was a problem with mobile phones
- How can AI/Robotics collaborate with Semantic Web community?  What are overlaps? How can data be exchanged? What types of data are you using?
  - Short answer is not using any external general purpose knowledgebases
  - What is the difference between Capoeira dancing and people fighting?
  - Social feature detection can try to discriminate
  - So you wouldn't have a database telling you that fighting involves more than one person, e.g.?
  - Typically a project will train a dataset and derive general rules
  - Maybe the dataset will be shared
  - Doesn't happen very often
  - Data protection laws have changed, so that makes things more difficult
