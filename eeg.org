- Could use top 3
- Don't spam the BioPortal recommendation engine :)
- BioPortal reports quality measures that speak to the affinity and specificity (to borrow terms from pharmacology) of matches in the text you provide
* Annotate the full EEG Report dataset
- Don't spam the BioPortal API :)
- Contact them to ask about rate limiting strategies or alternatives to hosting our own API on a virtual machine

* Retrieving all EEG Reports
EEG Reports are what the [[https://www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/html/overview.shtml][Temple University Hospital EEG Resources]] call the text metadata associated with recordings.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle ~/promptworks/tuh_eeg/scripts/find-all-eeg-reports :shebang "#!/bin/bash"
  find . -type f -name '*.txt' ! -name '*README*'
#+END_SRC
** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./scripts/find-all-eeg-reports > all-reports
#+END_SRC

Will produce a large text file =all-reports= containing the paths to each EEG Report.

The number of lines in the =all-reports= file, that is to say the number of EEG Reports, should correspond to the statistics presented in the top-level [[file+emacs:/Users/cliff/promptworks/tuh_eeg/www.isip.piconepress.com/projects/tuh_eeg/downloads/tuh_eeg/v1.1.0/_AAREADME.txt][_AAREADME]].

** Criteria for evaluating relevance of ontology recommendation
- Ontology Coverage
- Ontology Acceptance
- Ontology Detail
- Ontology Specialization

* Research
- [ ] Run recommender on raw EEG Reports
  - Don't spam the bioportal API
- [ ] Collect summary statistics
- [ ] Generate figures

- [ ] Parse EEG reports into fields
  - E.g. CLINICAL HISTORY, MEDICATIONS, INTRODUCTION, DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD, HR, IMPRESSION, CLINICAL CORRELATION
- [ ] Collect summary statistics
  - Did Primary, Secondary, Tertiary recommended ontologies change?
  - Did statistics for Primary recommended ontology get better?
- [ ] Generate figures

* Target Journals
- [[https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript/short-report][Journal of Biomedical Semantics]]
