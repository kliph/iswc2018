* Yuqing Gao
- Was with IBM Watson for 19 years!
- Maintain multiple Knowledge graphs for
  - Words :: mainly things and relationships... relates to words
  - Work :: Coming from Microsoft Office
  - Academic :: Researchers, publications, etc.
- Future work is going to look at Conversation → bots
  - Cortana?
- Knowledge systems Pyramid
  - Raw data → knowledge creation → high-quality semantically organized data
- Difficult to view a knowledge graph at scale
- Axes of challenges
  - Coverage :: Have we got the information we need?
  - Correctness :: Is our information accurate?
  - Freshness :: Is the information up to date?
- E.g. which "Will Smith", or "Patrick Smith" are you talking about?
  - Wikipedia has 200 Will Smiths
- Internal knowledge systems for enterprise represent another challenge

* Anant Narayanan
- Facebook is focused on *socially relevant* entities, concepts and words
- Started out analyzing data about what people are talking about
  - Started empircally, nice
- Enhancements for users
- Utility
- For example
  - Suggesting replies
  - Entity detection for sending a link to a Drake song that you are talking about
  - Stickers - Delight the user!

* Alan Patterson
- eBay has a Product Knowledge Graph
- Taxonomies correspond to Categories Tree on the left side navigation
- Problem
  - duplicate products because they're slightly different, coming from
    different sellers, etc.
- Moving toward
  - product pages showing a single product with different options for
    condition, color, etc.
- Connecting to external knowledge graphs for information about People (e.g. Michael Jordan) and Brands (e.g. Nike)
- Validation
  - Checking types with RDFS domain and range
- The biggest problem: Identity
  - Insight: Identity means different things for Producers (Sellers) and Consumers (Buyers)
  - It may be necessary to support different views of identity

* Jamie Taylor
- Knowledge Graphs
  - Moving from Strings → Things
- E.g. Sunfish the fish and Sunfish the sailboat
- Google has a knowledge graph panel that pops up for some searches
- Scale is so large that no single person can wrap their head around it
- Take a principled approach
- Challenges
  - Managing Identity
    - e.g. the Chicago Bulls before Michael Jordan left vs after
    - e.g. Sailing the sport vs the activity
    - e.g. Cuba: the island, the government, the culture
  - Managing Identity over time
    - Are esports a Sport?  Wasn't around when they came up with ontology for "sport"
    - Broadcast, podcast, streaming

* Anshu Jain
- Watson Discovery Advisor
  - Provides among other things framework for building knowledge graphs
- Watson Discovery Cloud Service
- Discovery is about finding the non-obvious thing
- Problems
  - Finding a new link between entities
  - Finding a new entity
- Cascading effects
  - Every piece of knowledge (fact) should know its cascading effects
  - Insight: Is there a way to encode or abstract this in how we're handling updates to records in TRM/Circles?
* Questions
- What's the biggest challenge that you have?
  - Facebook
    - Conflict of interest
      - Ramen restaurant owner decides ramen is fast food
      - What's the best Star Wars movie?
      - The answers to questions depend on who's asking
      - Global company needs to understand local sensitivities
  - Google
    - Managing consistency
  - IBM
    - Federating across multiple systems and arriving at a "correct" answer
  - Microsoft
    - How fine grained or coarse grained do you want to go?
    - Evolves
- Who plans to share these big knowledge graphs?
  - To researchers or others?
  - Via what services?
  - Facebook exposes a graph API for public data
  - Google: Invest in wikidata
    - But is Google going to give back to the community?
    - Giving back the Freebase data into Wikidata was an effort.  It's
      very hard.
- Are you using RTF, SPARQL, RDFS, OWL?
  - Partially
- Re: autonomy for Cuba the island, the government how do you grapple with it?
  - How intertwined language and colloquial thought about things are very challenging
  - Entity resolution: let's push the entity resolution to the runtime
    when someone is trying to use the entity.  The colloquialism may
    help you resolve it.  Maintain the three separate entities but let
    the users query decide.
- What kind of technologies do you use?
  - Multiple solutions
  - IBM
    - Text indexes
    - Existing database
    - In memory datastructures
    - Not using graph data structures yet
  - Ebay
    - Front end replicated log
    - Services can tail that log
  - Want from the open source community
    - Pluggable architecture for something like Kafka that can seemlessly update multiple stores
  - Microsoft
    - Can't use open source graph databases at their scale
    - Mix of at least a half dozen systems
- Reasoning?
  - Type checking and validating data at eBay
  - Facebook isn't using OWL
    - Find from Yelp that a Starbucks has wifi
    - Find from Foursquare that a Starbucks is quiet
    - Reason that it's a good place to go to work
    - Cool!
- Apache Software Foundation builds on the open software ecosystem.
  Business proposition is a service that you build on a common
  software base? Are you going to make a Comanche Software Foundation
  where we can share a common underlying system that is learning about
  Michael Jordan.
  - Applause break.  Good suggestion.
  - Google
    - Interesting way to lay the story out
    - Spent many years trying to lay the story out from core to context
    - This is where schema.org and wikidata have the opportunity to be
      the core foundation
  - Facebook
    - Translating the scale from something that is usable by Facebook
      and Google to something that's usable by researchers
- What are the research challenges that we should thinking about?
  - Privacy is an interesting challenge
    - On device learning
  - Federating across scales of graphs (large, more specific, and tiny)
  - Can we scan the news every day and identify new facts
  - Knowledge graphs can support deep learning, machine learning
    - Embeddings are trained on frequency of occurence
    - Frequency doesn't represent *meaning*
    - Prime place for knowledge graphs to make a big difference
  - Ensure that knowledge representation is a core part of the curriculum
