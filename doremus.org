* A knowledge graph for classical music
* DOing REusable MUSic data
* Music archives have detailed knowledge
- Stored in a variety of formats
- Archives can't talk to each other
* Applied semantic web approach to solve problem
* DOREMUS modeling
- Extension of FRBRoo
- Choffe, 2017
* Controlled vocabularies for music metadata
- published at ISMIR 2018
- [[data.doremus.org/vocabularies][data.doremus.org/vocabularies]]
* Dealing with different formats
- e.g. MARC file
- =marc2rdf=
- Free Text Interpreter
  - Labels arbitrary text with annotations from  controlled vocabulary.
  - Insight: would be nice to use when parsing EEG metadata
* Challenges
- Missing properties
- Similar property values do not necessarily imply a match
- Mismatches due to institutional encoding choices
* Legato
- A new data linking system
- Finds accordances among multiple databases
* Interlinking with MusicBrainz

* Questions
- =marc2rdf= tool - can it be used for other types of marc records?
  - It's specialized to the DOREMUS model
  - The marc interpretation part can be easily reused for other marc
    records
- Have you considered a successor to MARC that's rdf-based?
  - Not yet
  - Worth considering in the future
- Have you considered linking to literary works that are the basis for musical works?
  - Yes, that's the reason they inherited from FRBRoo
- Did you face challenges with the Free Text Intepreter?
  - Yes each institution has its own convention
  - And there were mistakes, e.g. in spelling of the words
  - Had to add disambiguation part
  - Used regex and then tried to confirm the results of the regex
