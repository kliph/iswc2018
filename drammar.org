* Questions
- How about the 36 dramatic situations or Vladimir Popf(?)?
  - Have shown that the 36 situations can be encoded in Drammar in a paper
  - Cool!
  - Claim is that the ontology is more basic than the 36 dramatic situations
- Will the corpus be available?
  - It will be available in a couple of weeks
  - Also planning to release the tool for visualizing situations
